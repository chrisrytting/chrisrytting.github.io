title: Where do we come from?

Have described myself as Beach House Girl of the Year meets Mahler Symphony No. 2 Movement V. Will again. 

Academically, I graduated with BS degrees in Applied and Computational Math and in Economics. I now do natural language processing at Brigham Young University. Someday, I will have earned a PhD from this place.

Professionally, I've worked at American Enterprise Institute, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, NVIDIA, and [Magleby's Bistro and Grill](https://www.maglebys.com).
